ðŸ“Œ What is an ARM Template?
An ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template is a declarative JSON file used in Azure to define and deploy infrastructure and resources.
Itâ€™s processed by Azure Resource Manager to provision Azure resources like VMs, storage accounts, VNets, etc.

Declarative means:

You describe what you want (the desired state), not how to create it.

ðŸ“Œ What is Bicep?
Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that simplifies writing Azure infrastructure-as-code.
Itâ€™s essentially a clean, modern alternative to ARM JSON templates, with easier syntax and better tooling.

Important:
Bicep transpiles into ARM JSON under the hood before deployment â€” so both ultimately deploy via Azure Resource Manager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why was Bicep introduced?
ARM templates (JSON) are powerful but verbose, complex, and error-prone.

Bicep simplifies this by offering:

Cleaner syntax

Better tooling (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense)

Modular support

Direct transpilation to ARM JSON behind the scenes
